#Expected Results

## Multiply By 3 Test
At the end of execution of multiplyby3.asm the value in $a0 should be 12 (a hex value of c). You can also test that it works for different values by loading a different immediate value (instead of 4) into $t1 on line 3.

## Jump Branch Test
This test ends with an infinite loop in the end section. One should stop execution manually once the program has completed and check that the values in $t1 and $t2 are both equal to 10 (a hex value of a).
